    "So far you have learned about Python's core data types: strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. In this section you will learn about the last major data structure, classes. Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible. Classes allow you to define the information and behavior that characterize anything you want to model in your program. Classes are a rich topic, so you will learn just enough here to dive into the projects you'd like to get started on.\n",

    "There is a lot of new language that comes into play when you start learning about classes. If you are familiar with object-oriented programming from your work in another language, this will be a quick read about how Python approaches OOP. If you are new to programming in general, there will be a lot of new ideas here. Just start reading, try out the examples on your own machine, and trust that it will start to make sense as you work your way through the examples and exercises.\n",

In this case, The `__init__()` method initializes the x and y values of the Rocket to 0.\n",

A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate.
